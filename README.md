# SEC-EDGAR-10-Q-Scraper
This repository contains a Python implementation for scraping and processing 10-Q filings from the SEC EDGAR database.  The script programmatically retrieves filings, cleans the raw text, computes linguistic metrics, and extracts financial data directly from embedded XBRL tags.
